# City Network Builder

City Network Builder is an interactive web-based game designed to help users understand and visualize the concepts of **Minimum Spanning Trees (MST)** using **Prim's Algorithm** and **Kruskal's Algorithm**. The game challenges players to connect nodes (cities) with edges (roads) while staying within a given budget, demonstrating real-world applications of MST in network design.

## Features

1. **Interactive Gameplay**:
   - Players select edges to connect cities and complete levels by forming a spanning tree.
   - Each level introduces new challenges with different graphs and budgets.

2. **Algorithm Visualization**:
   - Display optimal MST solutions using Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms for comparison.

3. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - Simple, intuitive buttons for starting the game, showing MSTs, and learning how to play.

4. **Educational Experience**:
   - Players learn about the differences between Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms and their applications.

## How to Play

1. **Objective**:
   - Connect all cities by selecting roads (edges) while staying within the budget.

2. **Gameplay**:
   - Click on edges to add them to your spanning tree.
   - Avoid overspending or unnecessary connections.

3. **Winning Condition**:
   - Successfully connect all nodes with the least cost.
   - Complete the level to proceed to the next challenge.

4. **Additional Features**:
   - Use the "Show Prim MST" and "Show Kruskal MST" buttons to view the optimal solutions.
